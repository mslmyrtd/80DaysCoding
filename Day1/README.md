In this John Smilga tutorial, you will learn how to create a random background color changer. This is a good project to get you started working with the DOM.

In Leonardo Maldonado's article on why it is important to learn about the DOM, he states:

By manipulating the DOM, you have infinite possibilities. You can create applications that update the data of the page without needing a refresh. Also, you can create applications that are customizable by the user and then change the layout of the page without a refresh.
Key concepts covered:

arrays
document.getElementById()
document.querySelector()
addEventListener()
document.body.style.backgroundColor
Math.floor()
Math.random()
array.length
Before you get started, I would suggest watching the introduction where John goes over how to access the setup files for all of his projects.
